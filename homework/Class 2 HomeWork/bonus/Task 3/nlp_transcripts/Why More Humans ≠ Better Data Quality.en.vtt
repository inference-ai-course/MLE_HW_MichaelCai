They're going to try to use LMS to

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
generate the data for you. They're going
 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
generate the data for you. They're going
to<00:00:15.519><c> come</c><00:00:15.599><c> up</c><00:00:15.679><c> with</c><00:00:15.839><c> all</c><00:00:15.920><c> these</c><00:00:16.240><c> crazy</c><00:00:16.560><c> methods</c>

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
to come up with all these crazy methods
 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
to come up with all these crazy methods
to<00:00:17.199><c> cheat</c><00:00:17.440><c> a</c><00:00:17.680><c> system.</c><00:00:18.160><c> So,</c><00:00:18.320><c> it's</c><00:00:18.480><c> also</c><00:00:18.720><c> this</c>

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
to cheat a system. So, it's also this
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
to cheat a system. So, it's also this
really<00:00:19.199><c> really</c><00:00:19.439><c> challenging</c><00:00:19.760><c> problem</c><00:00:20.000><c> to</c>

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
really really challenging problem to
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.910 align:start position:0%
really really challenging problem to
detect<00:00:20.560><c> low</c><00:00:20.800><c> quality.</c><00:00:21.199><c> It's</c><00:00:21.520><c> actually</c><00:00:21.680><c> really</c>

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
detect low quality. It's actually really
 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.509 align:start position:0%
detect low quality. It's actually really
adversarial.<00:00:22.640><c> And</c><00:00:22.800><c> so</c><00:00:22.960><c> what</c><00:00:23.119><c> we</c><00:00:23.279><c> found</c><00:00:23.359><c> is</c>

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 align:start position:0%
adversarial. And so what we found is
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.790 align:start position:0%
adversarial. And so what we found is
that<00:00:23.760><c> when</c><00:00:23.920><c> you</c><00:00:24.080><c> want</c><00:00:24.160><c> to</c><00:00:24.320><c> get</c><00:00:24.400><c> the</c><00:00:24.560><c> highest</c>

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
that when you want to get the highest
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.390 align:start position:0%
that when you want to get the highest
quality<00:00:25.119><c> data</c><00:00:25.359><c> to</c><00:00:25.519><c> train</c><00:00:25.760><c> alms</c><00:00:26.160><c> that</c><00:00:26.240><c> are</c>

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
quality data to train alms that are
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
quality data to train alms that are

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
already, you know, super intelligent,
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.029 align:start position:0%
already, you know, super intelligent,
you<00:00:28.000><c> actually</c><00:00:28.160><c> need</c><00:00:28.320><c> to</c><00:00:28.480><c> build</c><00:00:28.640><c> a</c><00:00:28.800><c> ton</c><00:00:28.880><c> of</c>

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
you actually need to build a ton of
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.550 align:start position:0%
you actually need to build a ton of
really<00:00:29.199><c> sophisticated</c><00:00:29.679><c> algorithms.</c><00:00:30.320><c> People</c>

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
really sophisticated algorithms. People
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.709 align:start position:0%
really sophisticated algorithms. People
often<00:00:30.960><c> think</c><00:00:31.039><c> that</c><00:00:31.439><c> humans</c><00:00:31.840><c> are</c><00:00:32.000><c> smart</c><00:00:32.399><c> and</c><00:00:32.559><c> so</c>

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
often think that humans are smart and so
 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.150 align:start position:0%
often think that humans are smart and so
if<00:00:32.880><c> you</c><00:00:32.960><c> just</c><00:00:33.120><c> throw</c><00:00:33.360><c> a</c><00:00:33.520><c> bunch</c><00:00:33.600><c> of</c><00:00:33.680><c> humans</c><00:00:34.000><c> at</c>

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
if you just throw a bunch of humans at
 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.590 align:start position:0%
if you just throw a bunch of humans at
the<00:00:34.320><c> problem,</c><00:00:34.559><c> you'll</c><00:00:34.880><c> get</c><00:00:34.960><c> good</c><00:00:35.120><c> data.</c><00:00:35.440><c> And</c>

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
the problem, you'll get good data. And
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.950 align:start position:0%
the problem, you'll get good data. And
what<00:00:35.760><c> we</c><00:00:35.840><c> found</c><00:00:35.920><c> is</c><00:00:36.160><c> that</c><00:00:36.239><c> that</c><00:00:36.559><c> is</c><00:00:36.640><c> completely</c>

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
what we found is that that is completely
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
what we found is that that is completely
untrue.
